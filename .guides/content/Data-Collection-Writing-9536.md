## Privacy vs. Security
Recently, the FBI requested that Apple Computers unlock an iPhone that was used by a suspected terrorist.  In this case, the FBI thought there was time-sensitive information on the phone that might lead to the arrest of other potential terrorists and would subsequently save lives and make America a safer place.  

Apple did not want to open their device, first claiming that there was no "backdoor" or way into an encrypted phone without the passcode.  Further, Apple did not want to create such a tool for fear it would get out and endanger the privacy of their customers.

Who is right?  Choose a side, either the FBI or Apple and defend their position.  Please cite specific reasons for your defense and make the claim in general terms of security or privacy as the first goal.
