Choose one of the following writing prompts to explore some of the ideas around the sharing economy

1) Hotels are regulated and required to provide rooms that meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  As a result, hotels have handicapped parking, zero-barrier rooms with accessible showers, etc.  Private homes are not required to meet ADA standards.  What are some potential pitfalls of the current room-renting paradigm as it affects handicapped and disabled people?

2) Taxicab companies have been regulated for a long time.  In very dense cities like New York City, there is a limit to the number of taxis on the streets.  Each cab has a shield attached to the hood that shows it is registered.  By limiting the number of cabs, New York has attempted to keep the road congestion down, so the roads are not clogged with cabs looking for riders.  How do ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft circumvent this protection and what are some implications of these services?

3) Imagine a world where self-driving cars have replaced standard cars.  All of the technical logistics have been solved and only a few people resent not being able to drive themselves.  There are two possible models for this future:
- Individuals "subscribe" to a car service.  When they need a ride, they summon a car to come get them.  Depending on their cargo (kids, big objects, etc.) the correct type of vehicle comes to pick them up (van, truck, single passenger car, etc.).  People do not own a car but can use their smart phone to summon one whenever needed.
- Individuals own a car that is self-driving.  This car is always available for their use and there is no wait for it to arrive when they're ready to go somewhere.

Describe the possible pros and cons of each of these systems.
