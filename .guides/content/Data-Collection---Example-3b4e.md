Suppose that every police car has a camera that logs are records the license plates of cars automatically.  The program can detect the plate number, logs the GPS position and time.  All of this data is stored to a database and since the process is automated, it takes no work on the part of the police officer who is driving the car on patrol.

On a typical day, you pass two police cars as you drive and another two cars pass your parked car, once at work and another time at home.  This repeats most days.  

How much information could the police put together about you based on this data?  Can they tell where you work?  When you work?  Could they tell if you did something that was out of your ordinary pattern?
