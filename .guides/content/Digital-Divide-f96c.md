We live in an increasingly digital world.  The combined works of all of humanity can be found on the Internet and people are able to connect with others around the world in ways never before possible.

Unfortunately, this access is not universal.  Many do not have access to the Internet due to cost, lack of technology, or other factors.  Education about computing is also uneven, with many schools offering no formal Computer Science courses.  This gap between people with access to technology and those without is known as the digital divide.

There is also a generational divide between "Digital Immigrants" who come to technology later in their life and "Digital Natives" who have grown up with technology as part of their everyday experience.
